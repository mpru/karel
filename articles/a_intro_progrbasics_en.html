<h2 id="some-ideas-about-programming">Some Ideas about Programming<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#some-ideas-about-programming"></a>
</h2>
<p>Computers are an essential part of our daily lives. Almost all the
devices we use have some type of computer capable of performing certain
tasks: washing machines with different washing modes, gaming consoles
for entertainment, powerful calculators, personal computers used for
various purposes, cell phones with countless applications, and many
more.</p>
<p>All these devices with different types of computers have something in
common: someone “tells them” how to work, that is, they provide them
with a set of instructions to follow in order to accomplish a task.
That’s what <em>programming</em> is about: it is the activity through
which <em>people</em> give a <em>computer</em> a set of instructions to
<em>solve a problem</em>. Those who perform this activity are called
<em>programmers.</em> Without people programming them, computers cease
to be useful, no matter how complex these devices may be. The sets of
instructions that computers receive are called programs.</p>
<p>Programming is a creative process: in many cases, a task can be
accomplished by following different paths, and the programmer is the one
who must imagine what those paths are and choose one. Some paths may be
better than others, but in any case, the computer will simply follow the
instructions devised by the programmer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, computers don’t understand Spanish or any other human
language. We have to give them instructions in a language they can
understand. For that, we need to learn a <em>programming language</em>,
which is simply an artificial language composed of a series of
expressions that the computer can interpret. Computers interpret our
instructions very literally, so when programming, we need to be very
specific. We must follow the rules of the programming language and be
clear in the instructions provided.</p>
<p>Now, why should we study programming if we are dedicated to
Statistics? The activity of statistical professionals is entirely
intertwined with the need to master computer tools that assist us in
various stages of our work, from data collection and cleaning, to the
application of different analysis methodologies, to the effective
communication of results. That’s why in this tutorial, we will study the
basic concepts of this discipline, fostering the exercise of abstract
and logical thinking necessary to effectively communicate with the
computer and make it perform the tasks we need. The programming language
used in this tutorial is R, widely used in the field of data science.
However, we must emphasize that <strong>this is not an R
tutorial</strong>, meaning we will not focus on learning the tools that
this language provides for data analysis.</p>
<p>To incorporate some basic programming notions, we will make use of
the help of <strong>Karel</strong>, a robot that lives and walks in
rectangular <strong>worlds</strong>. We will ask Karel to perform
certain activities, and for this, we have to program in R, so Karel will
accompany us in the first steps we take with this language.</p>
<p><em>Karel the Robot</em> is a programming language created for
educational purposes by Dr. R. E. Pattis from Stanford University
(California, USA), who also wrote the book <em>Karel the Robot: A Gentle
Introduction to the Art of Programming</em> in 1981. Its name pays
homage to Karel Capek, the Swedish writer who invented the word robot in
his science fiction work <em>R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots)</em>.
Its syntax was based on Pascal, a very important programming language at
that time. Over the decades, this teaching strategy has been used in
many places around the world, implementing <em>Karel in different
languages such as Java</em>, C++, Ruby, and Python. Many of the examples
presented in this guide were taken from Karel the robot learns Java
(Eric Roberts).</p>
<p>As far as we know, Karel had not been developed in R. Our package is
the first implementation, help us improve it by notifying us of anything
you notice that needs revision!</p>
<p>But before we delve into playing with Karel, let’s review some
concepts related to Programming that it’s good to keep in mind.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="problems-algorithms-and-programming-languages">Problems, algorithms, and programming languages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#problems-algorithms-and-programming-languages"></a>
</h3>
<p>We mentioned earlier that <em>programming</em> consists of
instructing a computer to solve a problem, and the communication of
those instructions must be clear. That’s why, when faced with a problem
that needs to be solved computationally, the first step is to think
carefully about how it can be solved, in other words, to create an
<em>algorithm.</em> An <em>algorithm</em> is a consistent strategy of an
ordered set of steps that leads us to the solution of a problem or the
achievement of a goal. Then, we have to translate the chosen algorithm
into the language of the computer.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that the computational resolution of a problem
consists of two basic stages:</p>
<p>1.<em>Algorithmic design:</em> develop an algorithm, or choose an
existing one, that solves the problem. 2. <em>Coding</em>: express an
algorithm in a programming language so that the computer can interpret
and execute it.</p>
<p>When learning about programming, we start by facing simple problems
for which the first stage seems easy, while coding becomes difficult
because we have to learn the rules of the programming language. However,
while with practice we can quickly gain ease in writing code,
algorithmic design becomes more challenging as we tackle more complex
problems. That’s why we will emphasize the formulation and development
of algorithms as a fundamental stage in programming.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="algorithmic-design">Algorithmic Design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#algorithmic-design"></a>
</h4>
<p>When faced with a problem, the first step is to devise an algorithm
for its solution and express it in writing, for example, in Spanish, but
adapting human language to logical forms that resemble the tasks a
computer can perform. In programming, the artificial and informal
language that developers use in creating algorithms is called
<strong>pseudocode</strong>. It is the tool we use to describe
algorithms by mixing common language with programming instructions. It
is not a programming language itself, meaning the computer is not
capable of understanding it. The purpose of pseudocode is to allow the
programmer to focus on the logical solution and then use it as a guide
when writing the program. In this tutorial, we will not be providing
examples of pseudocode writing. However, it is important to understand
that before attempting to program, it is essential to think ahead and
plan the algorithm, i.e., all the steps required to reach the solution,
and jot them down on paper with a pen while devising a strategy. This
can be a great aid in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="coding">
<strong>Coding</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#coding"></a>
</h4>
<p>An algorithm presented in pseudocode could use terms taken from the
Spanish language, which is a reasonable choice for sharing this strategy
among people who communicate in this language. However, if we want to
present our algorithm to someone who only speaks French, Spanish would
no longer be a good choice, let alone if we want to present the
algorithm to a computer. In order for a computer to understand our
algorithm, we need to translate it into a <em>programming language</em>,
which, as mentioned before, is an artificial language designed to
express computations that can be carried out by electronic devices; in
other words, it is a means of communication between humans and
machines.</p>
<p>Each of the actions that make up the algorithm is encoded with one or
more <em>instructions</em>, expressed in the chosen programming
language, and the collection of all these instructions constitutes a
<em>program</em>. The program is saved in a <em>file</em> with a name
generally divided into two parts by a dot, for example:
<strong><code>my_first_program.R</code></strong>. The first part is the
<em>root</em> of the name, which can describe the content of the file.
The second part indicates the use of the file, for example,
<strong><code>.R</code></strong> indicates that it contains a program
written in the R language. The general process of entering or modifying
the content of a file is called <em>editing</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="programming-errors">
<strong>Programming Errors</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#programming-errors"></a>
</h3>
<p>As soon as we embark on our journey into the world of programming, we
will realize that we will always have certain companions:
<em>errors</em>. Many times, we will try to run our code and it won’t
work or produce the expected result. No matter how careful we are or how
much experience we have, errors are always present. Over time and
practice, we will be able to identify and correct them more easily, but
we will probably never stop making them. This is not something to be
discouraged about, as solving the errors we make often leads to great
learning experiences.</p>
<p>Programming errors are often called <em>bugs</em>, and the process of
correcting them is known as <em>debugging</em>. It is said that this
terminology dates back to 1947 when a computer at Harvard University
(the <em>Mark II</em>) stopped working, and it was eventually discovered
that the cause of the problem was a moth found in one of the machine’s
electromagnetic relays. However, other historians argue that the term
was already in use before that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="processor-environment-and-actions">
<strong>Processor, Environment, and Actions</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#processor-environment-and-actions"></a>
</h3>
<p>We have defined an algorithm as a list of instructions for solving a
problem. In this context, the term <em>processor</em> refers to any
agent capable of understanding the steps of an algorithm and carrying
out the work indicated by it. To achieve this goal, the processor uses
certain resources available to it. All the elements available to be used
by the processor constitute its <em>environment</em>. Each of the
instructions that make up the algorithm modifies the environment in some
way and is called an <em>action</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="r-and-rstudio">
<strong>R and RStudio</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-and-rstudio"></a>
</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we will put into practice programming concepts
using <strong>R</strong>. Unlike many other languages, R is free and
open-source software distributed under the <em>GNU GPLv2</em> license,
which allows freedom to use it for any purpose, to see how it was made,
how it works, and to modify it, distribute copies, and create
contributions and additions for them to be available to others <sup><a href="https://chat.openai.com/#user-content-fn-2" class="external-link"><strong>1</strong></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Although R will be our means of communication with the computer, we
will use another program that provides some tools to facilitate our
programming work. In other words, we will use an integrated development
environment (IDE). An IDE is a program that makes coding easier by
allowing us to manage multiple code files, visualize the working
environment, use color highlighting for different parts of the code,
employ autocomplete to write faster, explore help pages, implement
debugging strategies, and even interactively execute instructions while
viewing the results as we progress in analyzing or solving the problem.
The most popularly used IDE for programming with R is RStudio, and it
will be the program we’ll be using all the time.</p>
<p>To install these programs, you should visit the official websites of
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/" class="external-link"><strong>R</strong></a> and <a href="https://posit.co/" class="external-link"><strong>RStudio</strong></a>, download the
installers, and run them. You can find a complete installation guide in
this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Bp11iZssc" class="external-link"><strong>link</strong></a>.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="organization-of-rstudio">
<strong>Organization of RStudio</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#organization-of-rstudio"></a>
</h4>
<p>When you open RStudio, you will see four panels:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="abrir_rstudio.png" alt="Captura de pantalla de RStudio" width="100%"><p class="caption">
Captura de pantalla de RStudio
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the left:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At the top is the <strong>file editor</strong>. This is where we
will write and edit our programs, and then save them (similar to a
simple <em>Notepad</em> or <em>Word</em> document). The first time you
open RStudio after installation, this panel may not be present, but it
appears if you go to
<strong><code>File &gt; New File &gt; R Script</code></strong>, use the
shortcut <strong><code>Ctrl + Shift + N</code></strong>, or click on the
first icon in the toolbar. You can open multiple files at once.</p></li>
<li><p>Below is the <strong>console</strong>. It is the window that
communicates with R. Through the console, we send <em>instructions</em>
to R for evaluation (also known as running or executing them), and the
results are displayed there.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the top-right corner, there is a panel with several tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environment</strong>: displays all the elements that make
up the environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>History</strong>: lists all the instructions that R has
previously run.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Other tabs that are not relevant for now</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the bottom-right corner, there is another panel with
additional tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Files</strong>: file explorer for your computer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plots</strong>: window where graphics appear if your code
produces any.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Packages</strong>: list of installed “packages” (more on
this later).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Help</strong>: help manual covering all the functions of
R.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Viewer</strong>: space to view program outputs with
dynamic or interactive components.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="using-the-console">
<strong>Using the Console</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-the-console"></a>
</h4>
<p>We can use the R console found in the left panel to enter our
instructions there, and when we press
<strong><code>Enter</code></strong>, they will be evaluated, producing
some results. For example, we can perform mathematical calculations such
as division, multiplication, addition, subtraction, exponentiation,
logarithms, square roots, and more:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fl">1</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="fl">2</span></span>

<span><span class="fl">5</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="fl">3</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 15</span></span>

<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 7.389056</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html" class="external-link">sqrt</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">100</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 10</span></span>
<span><span class="fl">1</span> <span class="op">/</span> <span class="fl">0</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] Inf</span></span>
<span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">2</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="fl">3i</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">3</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="fl">6i</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] -12+21i</span></span>
<span><span class="fl">1i</span> <span class="op">^</span> <span class="fl">2</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] -1+0i</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>While we can write our instructions in the console and press
<strong><code>Enter</code></strong> to execute them, generally, we want
to write and save them in a code file. That’s why we will write our
programs in the top-left panel. Once we write an instruction in the
script, we can <em>run</em> it (i.e., send it to the console for
execution) by clicking the <em>Run</em> button or using the shortcut
<em>Ctrl + Enter</em>. This way, the line where the cursor is or the
selected lines will be <em>run</em>.</p>
<p>In every programming language, there is a special character that,
when placed at the beginning of a code line, tells the software that the
line should not be evaluated. This is used to include
<strong>comments</strong>, which are lines that express explanations or
clarifications in natural language for ourselves or others who may use
our code. Comments are also used to add headers with descriptions of the
script or indicate different sections or parts of the program. In R,
this special character is the number symbol
(<strong><code>#</code></strong>). If we <em>run</em> lines that begin
with <strong><code>#</code></strong>, R will ignore them and skip them.
For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fl">5</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="fl">1</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 5</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># 5^2</span></span>
<span><span class="fl">5</span><span class="op">^</span><span class="fl">3</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 125</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="r-system-design">
<strong>R System Design</strong><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-system-design"></a>
</h4>
<p>R is divided into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>base</strong> (<em>R Base</em>), which is installed
when we download the program from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="external-link"><strong>CRAN</strong></a>
(Comprehensive R Archive Network). It contains, among other things, a
set of basic and fundamental tools of R.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Additional packages</strong>. A package is a set of files
that can be optionally downloaded from CRAN or other repositories and is
used to perform specific tasks. For example, to work with Karel, we need
to install the package that contains its implementation, called
<strong><code>karel</code></strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the <em>Packages</em> tab in the bottom-right
panel displays a list of all the packages that are already installed
(many of them come with R Base). There is also a button there to install
new packages from CRAN. Alternatively, you can run the command
<strong><code>install.packages("packagename")</code></strong> to install
a package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># Instalar desde CRAN el paquete karel</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html" class="external-link">install.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"karel"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It is also possible to install packages published in other
repositories. For example, it is common to download packages under
development or experimentation that are available on the GitHub
platform. These packages can be installed by specifying the GitHub
account name of the package author and the package name. If we want to
install the development version of the
<strong><code>karel</code></strong> package (not necessary), we would do
the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># Instalar desde CRAN el paquete devtools</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html" class="external-link">install.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"devtools"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># Instalar desde GitHub el paquete karel</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">devtools</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">install_github</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"mpru/karel"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>A package is installed only once, but every time we want to use it,
we need to <em>load</em> it so that its tools become available to us.
This is done with the
<strong><code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library("packagename")</a></code></strong> command, for
example, <code><a href="https://mpru.github.io/karel/">library("karel")</a></code>.</p>
